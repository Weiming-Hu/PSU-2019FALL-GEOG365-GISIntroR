## Introduction

Welcome to GEOG 365, Introduction to GIS Programming. The course materials will be in the format of R markdown files. Please make yourself familiar with the file format. We will also talk through the syntax during classes.

[R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents focus on the reproducibility. It provides a solution for integrating your programming codes into a formal document, e.g. PDF or HTML. It is also a tagged language so that you format your document by specifying various tags. A popular editor for R markdown is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

R markdown cheat sheet can be found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf). The file can also be accessed from Canvas.

A *typical code* block looks like this.

```{r}
# This is an example code
print('Hello, world!')
```
