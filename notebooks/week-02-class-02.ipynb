    "## Revisit Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we are going to specifically talk about for loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "For loops are all about **repetition**. A loop is a way to repeat a sequence of instructions under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for (val in sequence) {\n",
    "  # For each item in the sequence,\n",
    "  # the statement is evaluated.\n",
    "  #\n",
    "  statement\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a for loop, you need to follow the **preallocate-sequence-body** procedues. Here is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to create a data frame with 4 randomly generated columns, we would do the followings in a world **without** for loops.\n",
